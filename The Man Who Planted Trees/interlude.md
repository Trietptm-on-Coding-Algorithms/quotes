# Interlude to The Man Who Planted Trees

> To see a human being reveal really exceptional
> qualities one must be able to observe their activities
> over many years. If these activities are completely
> unselfish; if the idea motivating them is unique in
> its magnanimity; if it is quite certain they have
> never looked for any reward; and if in addition
> they have left visible traces on the world — then
> one may say, without fear of error, that one is in
> the presence of an unforgettable character.

> — Jean Giono, 1953
