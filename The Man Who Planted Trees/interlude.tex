\maketitle

To see a human being reveal really exceptional qualities one must be able to observe their activities over many years.
If these activities are completely unselfish;
if the idea motivating them is unique in its magnanimity;
if it is quite certain they have never looked for any reward;
and if in addition they have left visible traces on the world -
then one may say, without fear of error, that one is in the presence of an unforgettable character.
